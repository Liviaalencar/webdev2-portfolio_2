               <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
               <p>Pinterest is a well-known established company which is a picture-based website/app. It inspires people in different ways, fashion, art,recipes, design, DIY etc.</p>

               <p>If you like an image/idea , when you click into the post you can save it by clicking the red button called &quot;pin&quot; at the top right corner and they also give you a link below the image to their website so you can find more information on it.</p>
               
               
               
               <h2 id="">Registration</h2>
               
               <p>Its very easy to sign up to Pinterest, you can use it by connecting it to your facebook or even just sign up by using your email.</p>
               <p>Pinterest is available on android phones, iphones, windows computers and macs.</p>
               <p>You can login with your email, google or Facebook. You must be over the age of 13 to join, just like a lot other of applications.</p>
               <p>All you need to do is add your name, gender and what your interest are, e.g.: fashion, art, wedding dresses, ... ; based on your choices images will come up for you on the homepage.</p>
               
               
               
               <h2 id="">How To Use</h2>
               
               <p>Once you enter the website you wil see  different images na das you scroll down, more images will be displayed.</p>
               <p>On the top of the page you will have the navigation bar. Looking at it from the left to the right you will see the search bar, the home button, the following button, your profile image, a conversation balloon with three dots inside it and, finally, a bell icon (for the notifications).</p>
               <p>Once you find  picture you like you can save it to your pins. Pins act like your recent favorites and can be accessed whenever you want. You can pin it to a board which is the equivalent to an album, they can be named like you want. When you want to see you pins you saved you ust need to go to you profile.</p>
               <p>If you are more of a visual person, click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwFAdTOAOHc" target="_blank">here</a> is a link to a video on YouTube explaning it all.</p>
               
               
               
               <h2 id="">Cautions and Warnings</h2>
               
               <p>When searching about the cautions about the app I couldnt really fidn any apart from articles about Plagirism and copyright claims.People often &quot;pin&quot; images that are linked directly to the site and although a lot of artist are ok with this some are not. With a lot of them clamping down on the unlicensed use of their image. It also doesnt help that you Pinterest account is your full name and can be linked to you Google or Facebook account making it easier for them to find out who you are. But its very rare that the copyright claim is given to the users. Pinterest is more likely to face Copyright claims than its users.</p>
               <p>Pinterest is an app for ages 12+ and can sometimes you can find content on the app that could be triggering. Pinterest moderates all of its content but when moderating ceratin words they can&#39;t locate all of it. One word they recetly moderated was &quot;anti-vaccanation&quot; but were only able to clear up 88 percent of that content meaning that some of it was still on the app. When somone flags a post its removes the post three times faster than if the post was found by Pinterest themselves so when coming across content that youd dont enjoy or like its best to flag it.</p>
               
               
               
               <h2 id="">Using the app for teaching and learning</h2>
               
               <ol>
                   
                   <li>Getting Ideas</li>
                   <p>The best way to use Pinterest for educational purposes would be for getting ideas from the visuals on Pinterest for project based learning and getting ideas from. Going onto Pinterest and pinning suitable material makes it much easier for the student and the teacher</p>
                   <li>Monitoring trends in education</li>
                   <p>Pinterest is very &#39;trendy&#39; and is a great way to monitor changing trends in social media.</p>
                   <li>Examples of work</li>
                   <p>Students can use Pinterest while doing an assignment or project so they know they are going in the right direction. Teachers can also use this as a way to show their students what is expected from them from past work</p>
                   <li>Organising your Ideas</li>
                   <p>Pinterest is a great way of keeping your ideas organised by putting them into folders and labelling them. This makes them easy to find and view very quickly</p>
                   <li>Promoting</li>
                   <p>Pinterest is a great way to show off your work by posting it. If you think it is worth sharing, others may think it is worth pinning.</p>
                   <li>Find Other Teachers</li>
                   <p>Pinterest is a great way for teachers to find other teachers so they can share their ideas and tips with each other.</p>
