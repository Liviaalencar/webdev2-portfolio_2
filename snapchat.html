               <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
               <p>Snapchat is an app that is available on the app store (apple) and the google play store (android). It is a simple app. Once you download it and make an account it is amazing what you can do! You can send and receive videos and photos from your ‘friends’ once you have added them. You can also post to your ‘story’ which is something that all your friends can see. It is kind of like posting a status on Facebook or tweeting on Twitter. You can block certain people from seeing it. You can also make a ‘Private’ story which is one where you are in control of who you add to see the story. There are also public stories on snapchat and shows. From MTV to Beauty Insider, you can watch different mini shows or read articles. You can subscribe to certain mini shows or even news stories, so you never miss one! You can also chat to people without sending a video or picture, just like texting. There are also group-chats on the app in which you can have all your friends in one spot to text or snapchat.</p>
               
               
               
               <h2 id="">Registration</h2>
               
               <p>You can download snapchat on most phones; it doesn’t allow you to download it on computers only phones. It is actually very easy to register/join the app Snapchat! Below are the steps to do so:</p>
               <ol>
                   
                   <li>In order to register for Snapchat, you need to download the app from the app/play store.</li>
                   <li>Once downloaded you it gives you the option to sign in or sign up, as you need to create an account to use the app.</li>
                   <li>When you click sign up, it then asks you for your name.</li>
                   <li>It then asks for your birthday. The app is for anyone aged 13+ so they ask for your age in order to see if you’re over 13.</li>
                   <li>Once you’ve put in your age it then asks you to select your username it generates some for you or you can pick your own.</li>
                   <li>Next is the password selection. It has to be more than eight characters long.</li>
                   <li>You then need to add your email and then it asks for your mobile number, this isn’t a required step, but it is better to add your phone number.</li>
                   <li>It then asks if you want to find friends by syncing your contacts, you can skip this step and do it later if you want.</li>
                   <li>Then that’s it, you are signed up for Snapchat!</li>
                   
               </ol>
               
               
               
               
               <h2 id="">How To Use</h2>
               
               <p>The most common use of Snapchat is to communicate with friends via image based messages but you can also communicate by chats. Many people use Snapchat to follow celebrities.</p>
               <p>So the main use of Snapchat like the name suggests is sending messages as images. How this is done is when you open up the app you automatically are at the home/camera screen.</p>
               <p>From there you can take a photo by tapping the big circle which will change the screen to to show the picture you ook, it will give you the option to add text, draw, add stickers and how long you want it to last.</p>
               <ul>
                   <li>To add text just tap on the T button and you will be able to start typing.</li>
                   <li>To add a drawing just select the pen tool.</li>
                   <li>To add stickers just select the sticky note and it will give you a bunch of different options.</li>
                   <li>If you swipe to the left you are brought to the chat screen where you can choose individual friends or group chats to talk to.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Now if you go to the right of the home screen you’ll be brought to the discover screen where you can view your friend’s stories which appear at the top and Subscription stories which appear at the top and then below that are stories of people who you have subscribed too and below that are stories from companies and other creator that you may also like.</p>
               <p>To view a story all you have to do is tap it and it will begin to play.</p>
               <p>If you are more of a visual person, click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLxzFlrdZ08&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">here</a> is a link to a video on YouTube explaning it all.</p>
               
               
               
               <h2 id="">Cautions and Warnings</h2>
               
               <ul>
                   
                   <li>Age Limits</li>
                   <p>On the Appstore Snapchat is recommended to those 12+ years of age. The age warnings include; “infrequent/mild profanity or crude humour, infrequent/mild sexual content and nudity, infrequent/mild mature/suggestive themes and infrequent/mild alcohol,tobacco or drug use or references”.</p>
                   <li>Misuse</li>
                   <p>Snapchat is mainly used for texting and sending photos to friends. It can be misused by people by using it for selling explicit images or drugs, or bullying and harassment. Snapchat tries to prevent this but it still happens everyday. It&#39;s not endorsed by Snapchat so that type of content has to be seeked out or promoted through others. Due to this Snapchat has said that they can&#39;t guarantee the app will be a safe space so they ask you to follow the terms of service. If you violate the terms you can be banned from using the app.</p>
                   <li>Privacy and Security</li>
                   <p>Snapchat takes privacy and security very seriously. On their website under the privacy principles they make it clear that they treat the information of its users differently to other companies. “Snapchat’s designed so that people can only see the things you want to share, for as long as you want to share them”.</p>
                   <li>Abuse and Trolling</li>
                   <p>In an interview with ‘Teen Vogue’ they found that “Out of 10 teenagers who talked to Teen Vogue, only one claimed they had not been on the receiving end of harassment on Snapchat.” On snapchat there are many ways people can be bullied or harassed some of which include; screenshotting and posting private photos of someone on your story or sharing them with others privately and by using anonymous messengers available on the platform to bully people.</p>
                   <li>Images</li>
                   <p>There’s options to see the privacy policy and the terms of service within the apps settings. You can also ask questions through the setting menu on privacy and safety concerns.</p>
                   
               </ul>
               
               
               
               <h2 id="">Using the app for teaching and learning</h2>
               
               <p>There are many ways that snapchat can be used for educational purposes. Here are some examples:</p>
               
               <ol>
                   
                   <li>Q&amp;A’s are very helpful with snapchat as it is not as formal as using email. It sparks a better connection between the teacher and student, therefore the student may be able to take in the information given to them easier.</li>
                   <li>Another useful tool that snapchat has is the ability to create group chats for homework, useful links, notes, etc. What’s even better is the group call tool, this may not work as well with a large group but with a smaller group of students this could be very useful. It gives that person to person feel when you could be all be in completely different locations.</li>
                   <li>Snapchat has this tool where stories are taken down after 24 hours which would be useful for students who have any questions or need help with something. It is up long enough for the teacher to read but also it is automatically taken down after the 24 hour period giving anonymity and privacy to the student.</li>
                   <li>Stories are also useful for teachers to upload homework, reminders, notes and even questions for their students. Stories could be used for students to take part in quizzes or even links to useful videos or articles etc.</li>
                   <li>Either way the possibilities are near unlimited when it comes to snapchat, it is a very fun way to educate and stay connected with your students.</li>
