               <h2 id="">Cautions and Warnings</h2>
               
               <p>When using any social media app in general, there will always be an issue with safety. Using them with caution can minimize the risk but you will never truly be safe when using them as information gets leaked all the time. The best practice is to only put up and share information that you feel comfortable with everyone knowing.</p>
               <p>Some basic things you should know:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Don’t share your password with anyone</li>
                    <li>Even if you keep your account limited or private, it can still reach a wider audience</li>
                    <li>Think about what you’re posting. Can someone find you through the picture?</li>
                    <li>Instagram isn’t reality as people only post the best parts of their life</li>
                </ul>
               
               <p>With Instagram in general, there are many ways that you can stay protected. One of the easiest ways is to put your account on private. This will restrict access to your account, meaning no one can view your posts unless they follow you. People can request to follow you but is it your decision whether you want them to be able to view your account. You also have the option to choose who can comment on your posts. Your Instagram Stories are also private.</p>
               <p>However, if your account is set on private, your profile is still public so they can see your profile photo, bio and username. This shouldn’t be an issue as long as you don’t have any information you’re not comfortable sharing with everyone.</p>
               <p>When posting pictures on Instagram, you should keep in mind the location setting and the tags you use. These could easily show your location to people. Tags can also be used to see your interests and your location so use them with caution.</p>
               <p>You should also be careful when sharing beyond Instagram. If you have any other accounts on other sites like Facebook and they aren’t private, it could be shared to everyone.</p>
               <p>People can also get to your account if you like other people’s post and if you’re tagged in their posts or stories. You can un-tag your account from posts but you can’t from stories so you can ask the person to remove you from the story. Stories aren’t permanent so after 24 hours they get removed.</p>
               <p>If someone is harassing you, you can always block them and report them to Instagram. Try your best to ignore them and don’t post anything to aggravate them. You can also report people if they’re impersonating you or if they are a spam account.</p>
               <p>If you take these cautions into consideration, you can minimize the risk that comes with Instagram or any social media.</p>
               
               
               
               <h2 id="">Using the app for teaching and learning</h2>
               
               <p>Teaching and learning can be improved by using social media in education nowadays. Social media and technology has become a huge part of our daily lives with the majority of adults and teenagers with at least one or two different social media tools or apps which can be accessed from many devices. Since we all still use these apps, there are definitely ways to implement them into education. Some ways benefits and approaches to using social media in education are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Communication</li>
                    <p>This one of the biggest advantages to social media, it gives great access to communicate to anyone around the world. Students can connect with their fellow students and teachers easily and from a wide range of devices from mobile phones to PC’s.</p>
                    
                    <li>Collaboration</li>
                    <p>Students and teachers can collaborate easily through tools and apps such as Google Drive and Google Docs, making it easy to access files and documents that the whole class needs.</p>
                    
                    <li>Finding information and inspiration</li>
                    <p>Students can use social media to find information and be up to date to current events through apps such as Twitter. They can find inspiration for projects through sites and apps like Tumblr and Pinterest.</p>
                    
                    <li>Parents Involvement</li>
                    <p>Social Media in Education also helps parents to be connected and involved in the students learning. If the school has a Twitter or Facebook page, parents and students can follow to be updated on the latest news, projects and achievements.</p>
                    
                    <li>Improved Literacy, Communication and Reading Skill</li>
                    <p>Students are known to get bored with writing and reading with books and paper. Social media gives them access to information online which can be more catchy and interesting to read. It gives students a different medium to learn which can help with making learning easier.</p>
                                   
                </ol>
               
               <p>Instagram is a social app that can be used for teaching and learning in Education. There are over 1 Billion users on instagram with 72% being teenagers. 35% of the teenagers in the US said that Instagram is their preferred social media platform. This just shows that instagram has a huge potential to be used in Education.</p>
               <p>One of the first things a teacher should do if wanting to use Instagram as an educational tool is to set up a private classroom account which every student can join and follow. Then following from that, here are a few examples of how Instagram can be used for the purpose of Education in a classroom:</p>
               
               <ol>
               
                   <li>Finding Ideas</li>
                   <p>A great way teachers can find new and interesting ideas to use in class would be to search around on Instagram, there are many teacher and educational accounts around that can be followed and provide great ideas. Following the hashtag #teachersofinstagram will help a teacher find those accounts easily.</p>
                   
                   <li>Capture Memories</li>
                   <p>A teacher can post pictures of a lot of the memories made in class. This can be from regular days in class, to going on a trip or completing cool activities. This can remind the students of these memories and also allow their parents to see all the interesting things their children are doing at school.</p>
                   
                   <li>Show Students Work</li>
                   <p>Instagram is a perfect place to showcase students&#39; works and achievements, since it works on a basis of posting pictures with a caption underneath. The class account can act as a place to post award winning projects and achievements that the students have made.</p>
                   
                   <li>Help Students</li>
                   <p>Teachers can use Instagram to help students by posting homework and reminders for projects. They can also post useful tutorials or links to useful sites that the students can use to learn. The comments section can also be used to engage the whole classroom and students can learn of one another that way too. The Direct Messages can also be useful when a student needs to ask a question relating to a post privately if they don&#39;t want to comment.</p>
                   
                   <li>Subjects</li>
                   <p>Instagram can be used in many different ways depending on the subject being taught. Some examples are as following:</p>
               
               </ol>
               
               <ul>   
                   <li>Science</li>
                   <p>Students can take photos or videos of experiments that they are doing in school and post on Instagram, from there they could all comment on each others posts and examine each others results and differences. Teachers can also join and give critical feedback</p>
                   
                   <li>Art</li>
                   <p>Students can use Instagram to create a photo gallery of their photos or projects in art class. This gives parents, students and teachers to see their work, like and comment. It can also lead to them gaining followers that like their work and build a future portfolio and following which will be useful in the future.</p>
                   
                   <li>Music</li>
                   <p>Similar to Art, students can post short clips of themselves playing an instrument or singing. They can also make small tutorials for fellow classmates that might want to learn an instrument. They could also post and ask followers for opinions on a cover of a song or an original.</p>
                   
               </ul>
