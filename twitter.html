               <h2>Introduction</h2>
               
               <p>Twitter is an application that you can download on any android or apple phone through the app/play store for free. Twitter is a social media platform that allows you to post messages known as “tweets”, it allows you to like posts by other users and retweet their posts on your own page. Twitter was founded in 2006 in San Francisco.</p>           
               <p>On twitter you can use the hashtag key before a relevant word, this allows your tweets to be found easier by other users. By clicking on a hashtag in a tweet it brings you to any other tweets that also include that word or phrase.</p>
               <p>Twitters logo since 2010 is of a white bird on a light blue background. The bird is said to be the “twitter bird” and that’s why the posts are called “tweets”, as that is the sound the bird would make so it makes sense.</p>
            
            
            
                <h2 id="">Registration</h2>
               
                <p>Registering an account for Twitter is very simple and easy that basically anybody at any age that’s old enough for the application can make an account All you need is either an email address or a phone number to get started.</p>
               
                <p>Once you type up twitter on google it will load you up to this page where you can either make an account or sign into an existing account, if the person already had an account they would head straight into twitter and wouldn’t see this page.</p>
               
                <p>When you press sign up you will be introduced to this page and you have created a username for your account and you also have to either put your email address down or your phone number. The reason you have to do either one of them is because it will help twitter contact you just in case something happened to your account.</p>
               
                <p>Once you made your account you will be brought into this screen and depending on which option you picked they will send a code to your email or number and ask you to type it in just to make sure you’re not a bot or fake account.</p>
               
               <p>After that they will ask you to make a password it can be anything it just has to be at least 6 letters long.</p>
               
               <ap>After all that is done twitter will ask you to select thing that you are interested in, this will help them find and help you choose on what and who to follow on twitter since it’s your first time on the app.</ap>
               
               <h2 id="">How To Use</h2>
               
               <p>Twitter is a very simple app to use there are only really a couple of ways to use twitter.</p>
               
               <p>In the home page this is where you will see all the tweets from the people you are following you can also post your own tweets on this part of the app.</p>
               
               <p>The explore page is where you will find all the most popular topics around the internet or as people like to call it “trending” the bigger the topic is trending the higher it will be on the list for example the coronavirus is number one trending that the present moment.</p>
               
               <p>In the settings page you can change your email, block other accounts from following you and more.</p>
               
               <p>On twitter you don’t just interact with people by just tweets allow you can direct message them or “DM” for short as well so you can have a full convocation with people you know or other people from around the world it’s a another great way to interact with people.</p>
               
               <p>If you are more of a visual person, click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jWNpLvdocU" target="_blank">here</a> is a link to a video on YouTube explaning it all.</p>
               <!--There was no video avaible on Drive so I got the video from a YouTube account-->
               
               
               <h2 id="">Cautions and Warnings</h2>
               
               <p>Twitter has several things in place to give us control over our accounts. Their full privacy policy is found online, most easily through your own privacy settings on your account. The main things we have access over are:</p>
               
                <ul>
                    <li>Who sees your tweets – are your tweets completely public or locked for only each approved follower?</li>
                    <li>If you can be tagged in pictures – if this is ticked as no, then you cannot be attached to an image, however your name can be mentioned in a comment so this is kind of ineffective</li>
                    <li>Who can send you messages – much like your tweet privacy, can anyone send you a direct message or is it only your pre-approved followers?</li>
                    <li>If you can see sensitive media – if Twitter finds any material a sensitive topic, it gets blurred and you are warned before proceeding or have the option to back out.</li>
                    <li>Block and muting accounts – To block someone means they cannot view specifics which will be explained further below. You can also mute someone so that they don’t appear in your timeline but you can still follow them, contact them etc.</li>
                </ul>
               
               <p>A blocked twitter user can pretty much still see everything that you tweet, favourite, retweet, etc. You, as a blocker, are more effected. The blocked user:</p>
               
               <ul>
                   
                   <li>Is removed from your follower list</li>
                   <li>Will not show up in your timeline, whether it’s their own account tweeting or someone else you follow retweeting them</li>
                   <li>Will not be able to reply or @ you</li>
                   <li>Will not show on your timeline via retweets, favourites etc.</li>
                   
               </ul>
               
               <p>What is public on Twitter from your account regardless is:</p>
               
               <ul>
                   
                   <li>Your timezone and language</li>
                   <li>How old your account is</li>
                   <li>When and where you tweet</li>
                   <li>Your likes, replies and comment</li>
                   <li>Your address book if you upload it</li>
                   <li>Your twitter handle (username)</li>
                   <li>Your picture and header</li>
                   <li>Your name of which you can choose yourself</li>
                   
               </ul>
               
               <p>You can control some of this through your own device by turning your locations off. You can also delete your previous locations, address book and any other optional data you upload. You are required to give an email to log in, but a phone number is not required unless you wish to use it or you use two-step authentication for logging in. Twitter also use cookies for their ads but you can fine tune your ads or change it completely.</p>
               
               <p>You can report a user or a tweet. This report falls under specific categories and then Twitter have a team set up so that they will determine if it’s true and to which punishment the user will get, varying from the user having to delete the tweet, not being able to tweet just read their timeline, or having to delete their account.</p>
               
               <p>There are also ‘verified users’ for certain users. Initially, this was done based on how many followers someone had but has changed over the years. There’s now a process. Firstly, you must fill out a form. Then you need:</p>
               
               <ul>
                   
                   <li>Verified phone number and email – for the email, it is said for example if it’s a business to use an email related to the business</li>
                   <li>A bio, header and icon</li>
                   <li>Your birthday</li>
                   <li>A website linked in the correct place (not your bio)</li>
                   <li>Your tweets public</li>
                   
               </ul>
               
               <p>There are tips and tricks online but really it just comes down to the verification team. This processis still new and not available everywhere.</p>
